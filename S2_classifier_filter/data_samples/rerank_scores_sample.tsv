OMIM:144200	9551144	"In 5 unrelated German pedigrees with epidermolytic PPK, including the family originally described by {30:Thost (1880)} and the family previously studied by {27:Reis et al. (1992)} with linkage to chromosome 17q11-q23, {26:Reis et al.
(1994)} identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the KRT9 gene (R162W; {607606.0001}). Two other missense mutations were also detected in 1 EPPK kindred each, N160K ({607606.0004}) and R162Q ({607606.0005}), respectively. All 3 mutations involved highly conserved residues in coil 1A of KRT9.

Epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (EPPK) is associated with heterozygous missense mutations in the KRT9 gene, such as R162W, N160K, and R162Q, identified in various pedigrees, including German, F…"	"Journal:
